Hi, I've been working with development for 6 years, currently working with web development, I'm not a shy dev, like to discuss solutions, to be in contact with other areas and in a healthy working environment, with space for growth and contact with new technologies, I have great appreciation for teaching and learning regardless of being with a intern or a senior, I believe that we all have different experiences and what really enriches is sharing them with people we work with, only then we can generate value for our customers and grow as professionals.
I really enjoy listening to podcasts, love to cook and if there is an opportunity to drink a great coffee I will be there!

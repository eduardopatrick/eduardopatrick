# Hi, I'm Patrick ✌️
> If you haven't read with Goku's voice, you did it wrong 😞

>  I love technology and I've already worked a lot with some technologies like Ruby on Rails, Angular 6+, React, React Native, Vue, Vtex IO, FastStore, and others.
>  In the past 3 years I've been working on international projects and earning a lot of experience in English and Spanish for communication, also to build trainings or conducting technical meetings.
>  I also love to learn about people management and a few years ago I worked with digital transformation for a while, acting through employer branding to help the tech company where I was working at the time to consolidate and attract talents by the proximity to developer communities.
